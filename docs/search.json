Karina leads her department at TBF by developing, managing, and implementing federal, state, and non-profit grants to help execute the strategic plan for the Santa Monica Bay National Estuary Program, which strives to clean up waterways and create healthy habitats in the Los Angeles region. She is currently directing multiple projects to research and restore coastal habitats, including beaches, dunes, and wetlands. Career ecological restoration highlights include project implementation and leading the scientific monitoring programs for the Malibu Lagoon Restoration and Enhancement Project, the Santa Monica Beach Restoration Pilot Project, several other Living Shoreline Projects, and contributing significantly to environmental planning (CEQA/NEPA) for the Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project (577 acres).\r\nAs CRI’s Director of Programs, she developed and oversees the internship and faculty fellowship programs, conducts research, and teaches in Environmental Science. Current research fields include coastal ecology, coastal resiliency, restoration ecology, and water quality. In 2021, Karina won the Part Time Faculty Distinguished Teaching Award from LMU for her teaching and research service.\r\nKarina is recently finished leading the multi-year public process to perform major revisions to regional strategic plans, including a revised Comprehensive Monitoring Program and Climate Action Plan for the region. Karina is also a Board Certified Environmental Scientist, with a Biology specialty and is a Certified Ecological Restoration Practitioner (Society for Ecological Restoration). In 2021, Karina began a PhD program at UCSB in Environmental Science and aims to conduct research relating to ecological and physical trajectories of beach restoration projects in southern California in partnership with her academic and community mentors.\r\nPublications and Peer Reviewed Technical Documents (selected)\r\nBurkhard, J, K Johnston, J Saez, and J Dorsey.
