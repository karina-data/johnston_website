Figure 3. Word clouds for the Ocean Protection Council (top) and California Coastal Commission (bottom) sea level rise guidance documents (Data: OPC 2018, CCC 2018). This figure compared and contrasted text analysis results from two different California state agency sea level rise guidance documents. Both agencies have science-based approaches to understanding and planning for sea level rise through the implementation of best practices and resilience strategies.
